# Tomasulo Algorithm Simulation

This project simulates the **Tomasulo algorithm** using **Python**, demonstrating how instruction-level parallelism is managed in computer processors. The simulation provides insights into dynamic scheduling, instruction execution, and conflict resolution.

## Features

- **Simulation**: Models the Tomasulo algorithm, simulating instruction-level parallelism.
- **Input Processing**: Accepts a text file with instructions for processing.

This project provides a practical application of computer architecture concepts, particularly in pipeline execution and out-of-order processing.
